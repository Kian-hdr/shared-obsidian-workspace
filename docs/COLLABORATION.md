# Everyday collaboration

Start with the actual project's `AGENTS.md`. The tracker examples below assume setup
has completed and your terminal is in that project, not this toolkit repository.

## Start a session

Review the tracker before its first execution and verify its provenance with the
project owner. Choose an actor ID unique to your human/agent/session and do not use
an email address. Use your own identity; the test suite's example people are fixtures.
Run validation/status first, then use `sync --help` for required identity arguments:

```bash
python3 Coordination/project_tracker.py --help
python3 Coordination/project_tracker.py validate
python3 Coordination/project_tracker.py status
python3 Coordination/project_tracker.py sync --help
```

`sync` records what this actor has reviewed locally. It does not trigger or verify
provider propagation or Git operations. Check your actual access method separately;
remote synchronization is not applicable to local-only work.

## Own a bounded task

Use the installed command's help to supply its required fields:

```bash
python3 Coordination/project_tracker.py claim --help
python3 Coordination/project_tracker.py start --help
python3 Coordination/project_tracker.py change --help
python3 Coordination/project_tracker.py handoff --help
```

- `plan` records an unclaimed follow-up; a suggested owner is not an assignment.
- `start` lets an owner claim existing backlog after reviewing its evidence.
- `claim` establishes a new bounded work item and its exact targets.
- `check` verifies ownership, freshness, and dependencies immediately before editing.
- `heartbeat` renews an active claim when necessary.
- `change` records a material result, evidence, acceptance state, and dependency impact.
- `handoff` proposes transfer; the recipient uses `accept-handoff` before continuing.
- `complete` requires acceptance and validation evidence.

After claiming a real work item, replace the values in this example:

```text
python3 Coordination/project_tracker.py check --actor <your-actor-id> --work-id <your-work-id>
```

Inspect the [record schema](../skills/setup-shared-project-workspace/references/record-schema.md)
when diagnosing records. Use the tracker rather than hand-editing its operational state.

## Work in parallel

Divide work by exact files, directories, branches, environments, or artifacts. Two
agents must not edit the same target concurrently. A directory claim includes its
children. Agree on an integration owner and declare dependencies before work diverges.
Use project-relative paths for file targets. Each person's project may have a different
local root; a sender's absolute home or mount path is not a shared target identifier.

Claims are advisory on synchronized filesystems. Two disconnected computers can both
see an apparently free target. Do not continue affected edits offline when ownership
cannot be established. Coordinate directly with the owner through an authorized channel.
Never assume an expired claim means a contributor has stopped.

## Handle changes and handoffs

Record what changed, who owns it, validation and evidence, limitations, and the next
action. Mark impact `none`, `compatible`, `breaking`, or `unknown`. Review stale
dependencies before continuing downstream work. Preserve historical events; correct
them through a superseding record.

At handoff, confirm provider synchronization, update acceptance criteria, and identify
the next owner. The recipient must refresh their own context and accept the handoff.
Local validation, cloud upload, another device's receipt, and visual verification are
different checks. Report only the ones actually performed.

## Keep the vault portable and private

Prefer relative links. Use Obsidian for note moves where available and verify links.
Keep credentials, private endpoints, large artifacts, and machine-specific runtime
state out of shared notes. Do not change shared `.obsidian` configuration casually.
Agent rules and actor IDs are not authentication, authorization, or tamper-proof auditing.
